Xavier initialization for weights for neuroevolution
see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06567.pdf

temperature in addition or replacement to dirichlet noise
see https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lczero/blob/release/src/UCTSearch.cpp
hyperparameter tuning
use random seeds to distribute nodes and build client/server architecture
port to opencl DONE
add second command queue and more clever batching for GPU
node hashing DONE but little usage with so few playouts
virtual batchnorm -> prevent local minimum DONE
virtual visits for MCTS to OpenCL port DONE
what about loops in MCTS tree? should re-use stats
change cpuct value (its not a constant)
add FPU done
add weight regularization loss 
dont re-use the weights which were not accepted ?
